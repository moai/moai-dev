# Moai Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to the Moai SDK are greatly appreciated. We hope that these guidelines make contributing and accepting contributions as easy as possible for everyone:

## For Contributors

* [Fork the repository](https://github.com/moai/moai-dev/fork), create a branch, commit your changes, and open a pull request.
* Pull requests with bugfixes should be opened against the master branch, while features should go into the development branch.
* Implement larger features as an extension module (TODO: link to documentation/example).
* Follow the [Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/moai/moai-dev/raw/master/docs/guides/Moai%20Coding%20Style%20Guide.pdf).
* Try to follow the [Git commit message conventions](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* By the way, you do _not_ have to sign a contributors agreement.

## For Maintainers

* When in doubt, get a second opinion from someone else before merging a pull request.
* Before merging core changes, have [Patrick](https://github.com/patrickmeehan) review them, too.
* After pulling a bugfix into master, keep the development branch up to date by merging master into development.
* To contribute yourself, follow the contributor guidelines. I.e. work on your own fork and open pull requests. This way, we don't clutter the main repo with (even more) branches, and someone else can review and merge your code.
