  to website and verify file permissions.

Win32 binaries:

- Assuming the mingw cross toolchain:
- Checkout/download latest or other appropriate
  versions of libogg, opus, and any other supported
  dependencies.
- Compile them with:
    ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=/path/to/builddir
    make && make check && make install
  or similar. Wine is required for 'make check' to complete.
- Compile opusfile with:
    ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=/path/to/builddir \
        PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/builddir/lib/pkgconfig
    make && make check && make -C doc/latex
- mkdir opusfile-${version}-win32
- Copy AUTHORS COPYING README.txt include/opusfile.h to the release dir.
- Merge changes between README.txt and the version in the last
  binary release. E.g. it's good to include versions of the dependencies,
  release notes, etc.
- Convert README.txt to DOS line endings.
- Copy .libs/libopusfile-0.dll to the release dir.
- Copy .libs/libopusfile.a to the release dir.
- Copy .libs/libopusfile.dll.a to the release dir. (May not be needed?)
- Copy libogg/src/.libs/libogg-0.dll to the release dir.
- Copy opus/.libs/libopus-0.dll to the release dir.
- Copy any other dependent dlls
- Copy doc/latex/refman to opusfile-${version}-win32/opusfile-${version}.pdf
- Copy examples/.libs/*.exe to the release dir.
- Strip *.dll *.a *.exe in the release dir.
- In the release dir, run:
    sha1sum * > SHA1SUMS.txt
    gpg --detact-sign --armor SHA1SUMS.txt
- In the parent directory, create the archive:
    zip -r opusfile-${version}-win32.zip opusfile-${version}-win32/*
- Copy the archive to a clean system and verify the examples work
  to make sure you've included all the necessary libraries.
- Upload the archive zipfile to websites.
- Verify file permissions and that it's available at the expected
  URL.
- Update links on <http://www.opus-codec.org/downloads/>.
