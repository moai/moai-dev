This is the Kashmir Library.

The Kashmir Library is intended to provide functionality needed in many software
projects, but not present in the C++ standard library.

Languages like Java or C# come along with a ready-to-use collection of code that
take care of boilerplate work. Our goal is to provide similar code in C++.

We provide the source code, you can adapt it to any particular need.
