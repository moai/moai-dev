LICENSING NOTES:

Box2D, Chipmunk

	If you use Box2D or Chipmunk to make a physics based game or application,
	please include an attribution to Erin Catto (Box2D) or Scott Lembcke (Chipmunk)
	respectively. This isn't required by the license of either library. It's just
	good form.
	
	Physics engines are hardly commoditized and there probably isn't a 'native'
	alternative baked into your OS or platform SDK, so if physics is the main
	reason your game/app/whatever is fun, you should give these gentlemen
	their due.
	
Freetype

	Freetype requires attribution. It's use is optional in Moai. You may
	disable Freetype by building moaicore *without* USE_FREETYPE defined
	(see moaiconf.h). Alternatively, you may build a version of Moai with
	freetype to rip your fonts as a preprocessing step, serialize out the
	font files then load them into a distribution build of Moai that does
	not include freetype. In this way you may avoid both the FTL and the GPL.

OpenSSL

	OpenSSL requires attribution. Moai uses OpenSSL to add HTTPS support to
	libcurl. If you do not want to include the OpenSSL license, you will need
	to reconfigure libcurl to build without HTTPS support and/or provide a 
	native HTTP/HTTPS implementation of MOAIHttpTask.

Untz

	Untz is a commissioned work for hire by Retronyms for Zipline Games, Inc.
	It is kept in the 3rdparty folder simply to distringuish it from in-house
	software developed by Zipline Games. In a future release, it may be moved
	to Moai's source folder.
	
	Untz is part of the Moai SDK and is released under the Moai CPAL license.
	If Untz is used without the rest of the Moai SDK, the terms of the Moai
	license still apply (including attribution). Please review the Moai
	license before using Untz.

freetype 2.4.4
----------------------------------------------------------------
The  FreeType 2  font  engine is  copyrighted  work and  cannot be  used
legally  without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project
usable  to a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses described
below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using FreeType 2 in
any of your projects or products.

  - The FreeType License, found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
    to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
    you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's
    documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license
    is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public
    License.

  - The GNU  General Public License  version 2, found in  `GPL.TXT' (any
    later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the
    GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible with the  GPL due  to its
    advertisement clause.

The contributed BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar  to that
of the X Window System.  It is compatible to the above two licenses (see
file src/bdf/README and src/pcf/README).

The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is
compatible to the above two licenses.

  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
