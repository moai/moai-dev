LICENSING NOTES:

These notes are provided for convenience and are a layperson's assesement based
on a casual reading of the licenses in question. THEY DO NOT CONSTITUTE A LEGAL
OPINION. Zipline Games accepts no responsibility of liability based on any
misunderstandings that may arise from these notes or any mistakes or false
information contained herein.

The list of library dependencies above is not meant to be current or definitive.
By using Moai SDK you agree that it is your responsibility alone to be aware of
dependencies and to make sure your software complies with any 3rd party licensing
issues.

Box2D

	If you use Box2D to make a physics based game or application,
	please include an attribution to Erin Catto (Box2D). This isn't required
	by the license of Box2D. It's just good form.
	
	Physics engines are hardly commoditized and there probably isn't a 'native'
	alternative baked into your OS or platform SDK, so if physics is the main
	reason your game/app/whatever is fun, you should give Mr. Catto his due.
	
Freetype

	Freetype requires attribution. It's use is optional in Moai. You may
	disable Freetype by building moaicore *without* USE_FREETYPE defined
	(see moaiconf.h). Alternatively, you may build a version of Moai with
	freetype to rip your fonts as a preprocessing step, serialize out the
	font files then load them into a distribution build of Moai that does
	not include freetype. In this way you may avoid both the FTL and the GPL.

libpvr

	Like Freetype, libpvr requires attribution. Also like Freetype, its
	use is optional.

OpenSSL

	OpenSSL requires attribution. Moai uses OpenSSL to add HTTPS support to
	libcurl. If you do not want to include the OpenSSL license, you will need
	to reconfigure libcurl to build without HTTPS support and/or provide a 
	native HTTP/HTTPS implementation of MOAIHttpTask.

SDL

	SDL is used only for the desktop prototyping builds. SDL is licensed under
	the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL, not reproduced here). Make sure
	you read this license and understand its implications before using SDL in
	a commercial release of your product.

Untz

	Untz is a commissioned work for hire by Retronyms for Zipline Games, Inc.
	It is kept in the 3rdparty folder simply to distringuish it from in-house
	software developed by Zipline Games. In a future release, it may be moved
	to Moai's source folder.
	
	Untz is part of the Moai SDK and is released under the Moai CPAL license.
	If Untz is used without the rest of the Moai SDK, the terms of the Moai
	license still apply (including attribution). Please review the Moai
	license before using Untz.

freetype 2.4.4
----------------------------------------------------------------
The  FreeType 2  font  engine is  copyrighted  work and  cannot be  used
legally  without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project
usable  to a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses described
below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using FreeType 2 in
any of your projects or products.

  - The FreeType License, found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
    to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
    you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's
    documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license
    is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public
    License.

  - The GNU  General Public License  version 2, found in  `GPL.TXT' (any
    later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the
    GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible with the  GPL due  to its
    advertisement clause.

The contributed BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar  to that
of the X Window System.  It is compatible to the above two licenses (see
file src/bdf/README and src/pcf/README).

The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is
compatible to the above two licenses.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this

must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying

the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
but is also freely distributable.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."
