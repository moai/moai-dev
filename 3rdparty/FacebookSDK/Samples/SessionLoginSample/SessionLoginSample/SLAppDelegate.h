// Session Login sample application
//
// The purpose of this sample application is to provide an example of 
// how to log in with Facebook. The goal of the sample is to show how 
// to use the FBSession class for this purpose, with minimal additional
// sample functionality to distract from the core topic.

@class SLViewController;

@interface SLAppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate>

// FBSample logic
// In this sample the app delegate maintains a property for the current 
// active session, and the view controllers reference the session via
// this property, as well as play a role in keeping the session object
// up to date; a more complicated application may choose to introduce
// a simple singleton that owns the active FBSession object as well
// as access to the object by the rest of the application
