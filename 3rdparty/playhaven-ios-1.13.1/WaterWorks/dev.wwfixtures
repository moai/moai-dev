# Development Fixtures
# ====================
#
# A network fixture connects a network URL to a file in the app's resource
# bundle. To add additional fixtures, create a new file added to the
# Example (Fixtures) target and then add a line to this file with the URL
# it is supposed to substitute and the name of the file, separated by a 
# space.
# 
# i.e:
# http://example.com example.json
#
# Fixtures can match URLs and parameters:
# 
# - 'http://example.com' matches all requests to 'http://example.com'
#   regardless of parameters
# - 'http://example.com?parameter=1' matches all request to that URL
#   with matching parameters and values
#
# The system will try to pick the best match from available routes for
# any given request.
