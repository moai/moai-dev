4.0.6 - July 31, 2013

to one integrated with 3.4.8+ will cause Crittercism to be disabled. This has no
effect on fresh installs.

4.0.4 - July 25, 2013

5.0+

- Increases max stored offline crashes from 5 to 10 (default is still 3)

- Async breadcrumb mode performs all writes on a background thread; Previous
behavior batched multiple breadcrumbs but still performed up to one write per
iteration of the main run loop.

3.5.6 - May 28, 2013

- fix: App load count was not being reset properly on upgrades, which could
cause the user to be asked to rate too early after an upgrade.

3.5.5 - May 25, 2013

- fix: Corner case when user should be reminded to rate again but they don't
have internet access.

3.5.4 - May 24, 2013

- Add ability to configure "remind me later" count

- App foregrounds count towards the "Rate me after __ loads" count

- "Rate me" settings (has the user rated? did they click remind me later?) and
counts are reset when a new bundle version of the app is detected, i.e. when the
user upgrades their app.

3.5.3 - May 17, 2013

- fix: Don't show extra rate me dialog if app backgrounded when already visibile

3.5.2 - May 2, 2013

- fix: Small memory leak.

3.5.0 - March 1, 2013

3.4.8 - December 13, 2012

- Library automatically integrates with UserVoice if it is available

- Sends carrier data

- Sends locale data

- Adds getUserUUID method for retrieving the Crittercism generated unique ID.

3.4.7 - December 6, 2012

- Internal cleanup.

3.4.6 - November 29, 2012

- Added async mode for breadcrumb writing

- Removed delegate method that no longer applies since support forums were
removed in v 3.4

- Dropped docs from the package. The online documentation is the canonical
reference.

3.4.5 - November 6, 2012

- Internal cleanup.

3.4.0 - October 18, 2012

- Support forums have been dropped from the library.

- init* "initializer" methods have been deprecated in favor of enable* methods.

For example, you should call:

[Crittercism enableWithAppId:@"YOURAPPIDHERE"]

instead of

[Crittercism initWithAppId:@"YOURAPPIDHERE"]

This change was made to reflect the fact that the init* methods were not
actually init methods in the way most Objective-C developers would think of
them. Calling the old methods will continue to work, but will issue warnings
during your build.

- Reduce the number of headers we distribute. Crittercism.h is all you need.

- Eliminate potential conflict with JSONKit headers for users of that library.

- Improved support for delayed initialization of Crittercism.
