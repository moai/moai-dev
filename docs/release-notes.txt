Moai SDK 1.3r2 now available

Summer is well and truly over here in Seattle, but the good news is
that the pace of Moai development is picking up! The new Moai SDK
1.3r2 is now available for download. This release saw a focus on iOS,
with support for the iOS 6 SDK and Xcode 4.5 plus a round of new
features and bug fixes for all platforms.

We have updated the Moai Xcode project to support
Apple's latest Xcode version 4.5 and the iOS 6 SDK. What does this
mean for you? The biggest change is that Xcode 4.5 adds support for
armv7s and the iPhone 5, but drops support for older armv6 iOS
devices, and requires a minimum of iOS 4.3. ÊApple's armv6 devices
include the iPhone 3G and earlier iPhones, and the first two
generations of iPod touch devices. The Moai codebase on Êgithub can
still be used to build to armv6 with previous Xcode versions, but your
build flags will need to be reverted to support this.

Thanks again to Moai contributors and developers who assisted with this release.
