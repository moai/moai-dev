# This file is based off of the Platform/Darwin.cmake and Platform/UnixPaths.cmake
# files which are included with CMake 2.8.4
# It has been altered for iOS development

# Options:
#
# IOS_PLATFORM = OS (default) or SIMULATOR
#   This decides if SDKS will be selected from the iPhoneOS.platform or iPhoneSimulator.platform folders
#   OS - the default, used to build for iPhone and iPad physical devices, which have an arm arch.
#   SIMULATOR - used to build for the Simulator platforms, which have an x86 arch.
#
# CMAKE_IOS_DEVELOPER_ROOT = automatic(default) or /path/to/platform/Developer folder
#   By default this location is automatcially chosen based on the IOS_PLATFORM value above.
#   If set manually, it will override the default location and force the user of a particular Developer Platform
#
# CMAKE_IOS_SDK_ROOT = automatic(default) or /path/to/platform/Developer/SDKs/SDK folder
#   By default this location is automatcially chosen based on the CMAKE_IOS_DEVELOPER_ROOT value.
#   In this case it will always be the most up-to-date SDK found in the CMAKE_IOS_DEVELOPER_ROOT path.
#   If set manually, this will force the use of a specific SDK version
