*Broken Age* is already well known as the most successfully crowd-funded video game ever. Released to PCs, phones, and tablets, it delivers a classic adventure experience in the vein of *Grim Fandango* and *Secret of Monkey Island*.

[Double Fine Productions](http://doublefine.com/) chose Moai after a thorough exploration of the technology options. Watch this video for their reasons in their own words.
