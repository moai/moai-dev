*Freedom Fall* from [StirFire Studios](http://www.stirfire.net/) is a diabolical down-scrolling game with a whole lot of heart. An odd and creepy heart, to be sure, but a lot of heart nonetheless.  Freedom Fall is more than just a run-and-jump platformer and more than just darkly humourous twisted fairy-tale. It's a journey into the past that will let you determine your own innocence or guilt, but at what cost?
