title: "Anim-basic"

This sample sets up a basic scene and spins an image using the animation helper method moveRot (). moveRot () is part of MOAITransform. It, like all of Moai's animation helper methods, simply creates a MOAIEaseDriver and configures it to animate node attributes of the object being animated.

When you run this sample you should see an image appear on the screen and spin 360 degrees with a smooth start and stop.
