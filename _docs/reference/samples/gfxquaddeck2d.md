This sample demonstrates the use of MOAIGfxQuadDeck2D. Unlike MOAIGfxQuad2D, MOAIGfxQuadDeck2D supports indexing, hence the addition of 'Deck' to its name (although both classes derive from MOAIDeck).

MOAIGfxQuadDeck2D may be used to draw a single textured quad at a time selected, by index, from a set of such quads. All quads in MOAIGfxQuadDeck2D share the same texture but may have different model and UV coordinates.
