This sample demonstrates MOAIGfxQuad2D. MOAIGfxQuad2D is a deck, but does not support indexing. It may be used to display a single textured quad. By default MOAIGfxQuad2D will draw a unit quad showing the entire texture, but both the model and UV coordinates of the quad may be adjusted to display any portion of the texture at any location in space.
